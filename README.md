# UPLME: Uncertainty-Aware Probabilistic Language Modelling for Robust Empathy Regression 

This repository is the official implementation of our above-titled paper, currently under review.

## Environment Setup
This codebase is developed using `PyTorch 2.2.0` with `ROCm 5.7.3` in `Python 3.10` environment. Other required packages are listed in `requirements.txt`. All experiments are conducted on a single AMD Instinctâ„¢ MI250X GPU (64 GB), running on a Linux SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP5.

## Dataset
Raw datasets can be downloaded as follows:
1. NewsEmpathy22: [WASSA 2022 Shared Task](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/834#learn_the_details-datasets)
2. NewsEmpathy24: [WASSA 2024 Shared Task (Track 3)](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/18810#learn_the_details-datasets)
3. EmpathicStories: [GitHub: mitmedialab/empathic-stories](https://github.com/mitmedialab/empathic-stories)

Datasets should be kept in the `data/` directory. The preprocessing code `src/preprocess.py` (which is called automatically during training) will preprocess the required dataset set in the experiment configuration file. Preprocessing includes data augmentation. Augmented file is saved in the `data/` directory (with a suffix `_augmented`), and when this file is present, no additional augmentation is done.

## How to Run
We use `Hydra` for configuration management. The `config/defaults.yaml` file contains the default configuration, while the experiment-specific configurations are defined across the configuration files available as `config/expt/**.yaml` files.

All experiments, including training and evaluation, are managed through the `job_main.sh` script. This script requires the `EXPT_FILE_NAME` variable to be set, which corresponds to the specific experiment configuration file in the `config/expt/` directory mentioned above. 

For example, to train UPLME, set (or uncomment) `EXPT_FILE_NAME="train-uplme"` in the script.

To run the script, execute the following command in your terminal:
```bash
./job_main.sh
```

Or, if you are in an HPC environment, you may need to submit it as a job:
```bash
sbatch job_main.sh
```
